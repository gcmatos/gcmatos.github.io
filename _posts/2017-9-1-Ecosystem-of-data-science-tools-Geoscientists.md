#### Free and open-source softwares (FOSS) for data science

![Ecosystem of tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcmatos/gcmatos.github.io/master/images/foss.png)

Geologists deal with data provided from Earth through measuring devices (e.g. compass, GPS, cameras, etc.) and we are constantly facing highly complex physical features and sparse datasets that can make us feel stuck and hopeless. Commercial softwares also don't provide all the resources needed for problem solving. We have to process a broad range of types and sizes of structured and unstructured raw data.

In this article I will give a glimpse on some of the main tools that I find useful in my daily activities as a geologist and data scientist. On each one of the following items you will find a brief description and key links for you to go further into your topics of interest. It's not suppose to be a tutorial, I just pretend to give the reader some orientations in the data science world, based on my self-learning experience.

**Python** is the first and most basic tool. It's a multi-proposal interpreted progamming language created by [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io//) (firt released in 1991) that is extensevely used by scientists, developers, software engineers and hackers.

- [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) which is a open-source platform for data science

In Python you can type in a command line and hit return key without the need of compile the code to see the results as:

```python
>>> # Python 3: Simple output example from python.org
... print("Hello, I'm Python!")
Hello, I'm Python!
```
In this code snippet above, the `>>>` is the first line of the interpreter prompt, `#` means it is a comment, `...` means the prompt continues on the second line with the function `print()`, and the last line is the output from the interpreter. It is very simple and straight forward.

**R** is the second tool in our list. It's a programming language specially designed for statistic analysis. You will find an extensive list of libraries that allow us to have access useful datasets and functions for data analysis in their repository [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). R community also provide us with high level books, articles and tutorials.
