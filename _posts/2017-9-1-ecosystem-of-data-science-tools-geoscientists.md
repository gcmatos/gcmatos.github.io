title: Ecosystem of data science tools for geoscientists
---
#### Open-source suite of tools for applying data science on geological problems.

![Ecosystem of tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcmatos/gcmatos.github.io/master/images/Intro.png)

Geologists deal with data provided from Earth through measuring devices (e.g. compass, GPS, cameras, etc.) and we are constantly facing highly complex physical features and sparse datasets that can make us feel stuck and hopeless. Commercial softwares also don't provide all the resources needed for problem solving. We have to process a broad range of types and sizes of structured and unstructured raw data. 

In this article I will try to describe all the tools that I found useful in my daily activities as a Geologist and Data Scientist. In each one of the following items you will find a brief description and links for you to go further into your topics of interest. It's not suppose to be a tutorial, I just pretend to give the reader some orientations in the Data Science world, based on my self learning experience from a Petroleum Geologist to a Geologist Data Scientist.

The first and most basic tool is Python. It's a multi-proposal progamming language created by Guido van Rossum (firt released in 1991) that is extensevely used by scientists, developers, software engineers and hackers.
