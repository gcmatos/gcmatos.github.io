Hi all, I'm a geologist, MSc., with 10 years of experience in Structural Geology applied to Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFR) in Petrobras' Reasearch Lab, where I coordinated R&D projects regarding natural fracture prediction basecally on pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. 

Since 2014, I've been into data science focusing in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) an Machine Learning, using Matlab, Python and, recently in R. My goal is to improve automate data analysis routines for decision making ans forecasting.
