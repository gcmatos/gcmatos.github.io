Hi, I'm Gabriel Matos. I'm best known as a Geologist, but I enjoy other activities like taking care of my twin daughters, photography, rock climbing and playing flute.

My expertise is in Structural Geology applied to characterization and modeling of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFR).

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [Fu2re Smart Solutions](https://www.fu2re.com.br/) where we focus on creating and developing systems for solving Geological and Geophysical problems. I've been focused on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Python and R. My goal is to improve and automate data analysis routines for decision-making and forecasting tasks such as natural fracture prediction.
