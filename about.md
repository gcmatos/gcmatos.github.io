Hi, I'm Gabriel Matos. I'm best known as Geologist, but I do a bunch of other things like take care of my twin daughthers, rock climbing and play flute.

My expertise is basically on Structural Geology applied to characterization and modeling of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs (NFR).

Recently, I'm into data science applied to geological problems. I've been focused on Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence in Python and R. My goal is to improve and automate data analysis routines for decision-making and forecasting tasks such as natural fracture prediction.
